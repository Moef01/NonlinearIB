# Nonlinear Information Bottleneck (NIB) PyTorch Implementation

PyTorch implementation of ["Nonlinear Information Bottleneck, 2019"](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/21/12/1181), from Artemy Kolchinsky, Brendan D. Tracey and David H. Wolpert. This implementation was inspired by the authors' Tensorflow implementation, which can be found on ["Artemy Kolchinsky's github"](https://github.com/artemyk/nonlinearIB).

This repository include a single python script containing a NIB layer and NIB loss-function, which follows the same structure and guidelines as standard PyTorch modules. Include the NIB layer as part of your model and use the loss-function as usual.
